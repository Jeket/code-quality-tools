> STRV's ESLint config for React projects

## Configurations

### `@strv/eslint-config-react`

Use this ruleset to configure ESLint to work with React code.

### `@strv/eslint-config-react/optional`

Use this ruleset in conjunction with the above ruleset. Provides additional insights into potential inconsistencies in the project.

> For new projects, it is recommended to enable this ruleset. For existing projects, it is only recommended for the brave.

## Coding styles

### `@strv/eslint-config-react/style`

This ruleset includes rules which deal with how the code looks like and not how it works. It helps keeping the code clean and consistent. üé®

## Recommended ESLint config

```js
// .eslintrc.js

'use strict'

module.exports = {
  extends: [
    '@strv/react',
    '@strv/react/optional',
    '@strv/react/style',
  ],
}
```

<details>
<summary><i>.eslintrc</i> or <i>.eslintrc.json</i></summary>

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@strv/react",
    "@strv/react/optional",
    "@strv/react/style"
  ]
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><i>package.json</i></summary>

```json
{
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "@strv/react",
      "@strv/react/optional",
      "@strv/react/style"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

It is also recommended that you lint the whole project folder (ie. `npx eslint .`) instead of just
some folders (ie. `npx eslint src test`) and create an _.eslintignore_ file excluding any unwanted
lint folders. Doing so will allow new directories to be created without worrying about having to update your
tools to lint the new directory.

```ini
# .eslintignore

node_modules

# NOTE:
# The following directives are only relevant when linting the whole
# project directory, ie. running `eslint .` ‚ö†Ô∏è

# If you compile JavaScript into some output folder, exclude it here
dist

# Highly recommended to re-include JavaScript dotfiles to lint them
# (This will cause .eslintrc.js to be linted by ESLint ü§ò)
!.*.js

# Some tools use this pattern for their configuration files. Lint them!
!*.config.js
```
